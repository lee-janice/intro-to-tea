## Mythical roots

According to legend, the story of tea began in China in 2737 BC. Emperor Shen Tong, a renowned ruler and 
skilled herbalist, was sitting beneath a tree while his servant was boiling water, when a leaf from the 
tree drifted into the pot. The Emperor tried the brew and enjoyed the drink so much that he ordered 
further research into the plant, and thus the cultivation of tea began!

## Historical origins in the East

Containers for tea have been discovered in tombs dating back to the Han dynasty (202 BCâ€“220 AD), 
but it wasn't until the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) that the consumption of tea became widespreadâ€”so much 
so that tea was established as the national drink of China.

During the Tang dynasty, a Buddhist monk named Lu Yu (733-804) wrote the *The Classic of Tea*, which is the 
first known treatise on tea in the world. His work detailed methods and tools for producing, brewing, and drinking tea, 
as well as the history and philosophy of tea.

Tea was introduced to Japan in the 9th century by Buddhist monks who traveled there from China to study. However, due to the isolated 
nature of the monasteries in which the plant was first cultivated, its popularity as a drink only became established 
by the 13th century. 

## The introduction of tea to the West

Around the same time that it was introduced to Japan, mention of boiling tea leaves began to appear 
in trade documents in the Middle East. Additionally, Marco Polo (1254-1324) alluded to the consumption of tea 
in his writings during his travels. However, it wasn't until the 17th century that tea made a marked appearance 
in Western culture.  

The first to bring tea to the West were Portuguese missionaries, but it was the Dutch who 
first began to commercially trade tea. In 1610, the Dutch East India Company brought shipments of Japanese and 
Chinese tea to the European shores, and spread rapidly across the continent, though it was primarily consumed
by those in the royal and aristocratic classes.

Tea gained a foothold in Britain with the marriage of Charles II to Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza, 
who was a certified tea addict. Her love of the beverage legitimized it as a fashionable drink among the upper classes. 
Soon after, the British East India Trade Company was established, and soon became the world's dominant trading power.
Then, through the unfortunate and harrowing acts of colonization, tea spread to other regions such as India and the Americas.

## Tea drinking in the modern day

Nowadays, tea is ubiquitous across the globe. In 2022, almost 7 billion kilograms of tea was consumed worldwide.
In a 2022 Statista survey, Turkey had the highest reported rate of tea drinkers, with 90% of respondents saying that 
they regularly consume tea. In the US and China, respectively, 59% and 45% of respondents regularly consume tea.

// ## Rules for change

// The state of an automaton evolves over time, 
// just like how the state of a game of chess or checkers changes with each player's move.
// But rather than being determined by the calculations of two opposing players, 
// [mark]the next state of an automaton is determined according to a set of **rules**[/mark] 
// that change the state of each cell according to the states of its neighbors.  

// Let's look at an example.
