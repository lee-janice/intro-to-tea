affects the tea’s qualities. In its general form, processing tea involves different ways of 
oxidizing the leaves, stopping the oxidation process, and drying the leaves. </p><p>The classification chart below demonstrates the processing that each category of tea undergoes.
In the following section, we’ll dive into more detail regarding the processing steps.</p><span class="aside-container"><span class="aside"><div style="font-size:12px;text-align:left;width:200px" idyll="[object Object]">

controlled wilting, which prepares the leaves for processing by reducing their moisture content. 
The process usually occurs either outside or indoors in troughs with forced air.
The withering process is complete once the tea leaves have lost around 30-50% of their moisture, 
which typically takes 8-20 hours. </p><p>The withering process causes the membranes of the tea leaves to open, making them more supple and 
less prone to breaking in further processing steps. Withering also has chemical effects: the 
chlorophyll in the leaf begins to disintegrate, caffeine levels increase, new flavor and aroma 
compounds develop, and grassy flavors dissipate. So, the “grassier” teas, like green tea, are 
typically withered for a short amount of time, or sometimes not at all.</p><span class="aside-container"><span class="aside"><div style="font-size:12px;text-align:left;width:200px" idyll="[object Object]">
